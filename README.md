## Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Certification

While earning my Scientific Computing with Python certification from freecodecamp.org I completed 5 different projects that focussed on various topics in Python.

##Project 1: Arithmetic Formatter

This project mainly focussed on the use of strings and how to manipulate them and format outputs in a certain way.




### Project 2: Time Calculator

This project accepted current time and amount of elapsed time as user inputs.  The program then calculated what the output time and date would be based on the user inputs and
printed that out to the user.




### Project 3: Budget App

This project really focussed on the fundamentals of OOP in Python.  The user can input different budget categories with deposit and withdrawal amounts and the program keeps
track of the users overall budget.  In the end it can output a chart that breaks down how the users budget was allocated among the different input categories.  I learned
alot about the fundamentals of OOP through this project and formatting the output was a challenge.




### Project 4: Polygon Area Calculator

This project was another project focussed on the fundamentals of OOP in Python (specifically on inheritance of subclasses).  The user inputs the size of a 
rectangle or square and the program outputs a "picture" (an array of * symbols) with the proper dimensions.  This project was not a difficult one, it was really 
meant to reinforce the fundamentals of OOP from the previous project.
